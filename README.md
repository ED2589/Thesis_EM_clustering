# Variable selection for clustering via Manly transformation

Partial R scripts & final presentation for my undergraduate thesis project.

 I developed a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that is used to select variables in *skewed data* to reduce data dimensionality and increase clustering accuracy. I tested the algorithm on real datasets and compared it to state-of-the-art variable selection techniques.

Keywords: EM algorithm, dimensional reduction, clustering,unsupervised learning, skewed data
